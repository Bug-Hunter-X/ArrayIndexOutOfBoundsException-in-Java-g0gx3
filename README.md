# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside its valid index range, resulting in this exception.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of carefully managing array indices in Java to avoid runtime errors.  Remember that array indices are zero-based and the last valid index is `array.length - 1`.
